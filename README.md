# About

Converting the generic Matlab codes into python.
 I used `pylsls` and `psychopy` libraries instead of the Matlab libraries.

Currently converted only the SSVEP1 code.

The `simulated_EEG_stream` was created in order to 
simulate EEG stream with 8 channels. I used it 
in order to see the output of two different streams
together.

The `exp_example.xdf` contain the output. Try to use 
`pyxdf` library to load the xdf file.
